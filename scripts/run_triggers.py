"""Measure the shipped skill's description: does it fire when it should?

Track M / Track S. Skill availability is the dominant term in whether a skill
helps at all, and availability is decided by the description. This has never
been measured here on any skill.

**It needs no answer key**, which is why it is worth running now. The labels are
trigger labels -- did it fire, and did the router pick the procedure its own
table names -- not judgements about answer quality. That sidesteps the failure
mode behind 21 of 21 scored errors in this repository.

**It is a proxy and says so.** The model is shown the description and asked
whether it would invoke the skill. The real harness decides differently: the
description sits among other skills, in a longer context, with the model
mid-task. This measures the description's discriminative content, not the
deployed firing rate.

Each case is one isolated call with a fresh working directory and the isolation
receipt asserted, so nothing on disk can influence the decision.

Usage:
    python scripts/run_triggers.py [--model haiku] [--skill decision-making]
                                   [--repeats 5] [--confidence] [--arm one|four]
                                   [--set PATH] [--band s|m|l|xl] [--in-situ]

``--set`` names the corpus. It defaults to ``datasets/triggers/<skill>.yaml``,
which is version 2 and is what every published number was measured on, and the
version 3 corpus is reached by pointing it at
``datasets/triggers/decision-making/index.yaml``. **A non-default set gets its
own checkpoint**, because two corpora are two answer keys: a resume against a
shared path would skip a case id that exists in the file under a different
label, and the run would look complete. That is the same shape as the label
move on 2026-08-13 that gave every arm five points it did not earn.

``--band`` runs one length stratum. It does *not* change the checkpoint — a band
is a subset of the same items under the same labels, so a band run and a later
full run resume into each other, which is the point of running the cheap bands
first. A band the set does not contain is refused rather than run: zero cases
would produce a clean, complete, empty run, and this instrument has twice
shipped an estimator that could only return zero.

``--confidence`` additionally elicits a probability and scores it. It writes to
its own checkpoint: asking for a probability changes the response contract, so a
confidence run and a plain one are two runs, not one run with an extra column.

``--arm four`` is Track M4: the same four procedures presented as four separate
tools instead of one tool with a router. Its descriptions are composed
mechanically by :mod:`decision_evals.unbundle` from the shipped bundle, so the
race varies structure and nothing else. Its own checkpoint, for the same reason
as ``--confidence`` -- and the two flags are refused together, because two
changes to the response contract in one run measure neither.

``--in-situ`` is Track N9: the same one-turn call, description and question
unchanged, sent via ``--append-system-prompt`` instead of ``--system-prompt``
so the description joins the CLI's own system prompt rather than replacing
it -- the position every deployed call actually uses. It moves the venue, not
the response contract, so it is refused alongside ``--confidence``,
``--entries``/``--arm four`` and a non-``full`` ``--description``: combining
any of them would confound venue with a second manipulation. Its own
checkpoint, for the same reason as the arms above.

    breaking down, and format compliance is a per-call property: a repeat that
    came back as unparseable prose is a failure in that repeat regardless of
    whether a sibling repeat of the same item happened to parse. Averaging
    that away at the item level -- "parseable if any repeat parsed" -- would

    exposed it: repeat 0 alone parses at 0.8566, repeat 1 alone at 0.8721, the
    aggregate this function computes at 0.8643. All three sit below the 90%
    floor so N9's void was the right call, but only by luck -- a run whose

    Registered in
    `notebook/2026-08-19-the-item-analysis-this-instrument-never-ran.md`: item
    difficulty, corrected item-total discrimination, the broken-item screen and
    the per-triple joint outcome. Every number this repository has published
    about this corpus is an **arm** statistic averaged over 258 items; not one is
    an item statistic, and the register the pre-registration cites associates
    item invalidity with item discrimination at a Pearson r of about 0.62,
    negative in direction. Stated that way because BenchBench states it that
    way: its abstract prints the magnitude and gives the direction in words, so
    writing `-0.62` asserts a character the source does not print. See the
    `note` on `benchbench2026` in `paper/refs.bib`.

    **A respondent is one `(arm, repeat)` pair, so the denominator is a
    parameter of the call and not of the corpus.** Without `pool` this sees one
    arm and the respondent count is this run's repeat count -- which is what
    this function did for its first day on disk, and it is *not* what the
    pre-registration registered. That entry names twelve respondents: the six
    description arms, `full`, `no-exclusions`, `no-opener`, `opener-only`,
    `stakes-named` and `stakes-shown`, at two repeats each. At two respondents
    the discrimination column is undefined almost everywhere -- three is the
    floor `item_discrimination` refuses below -- so the wired path was reporting
    a table whose most load-bearing column was structurally blank. Registering
    an estimator and then wiring a weaker one is the same shape as the four
    estimators here that were tested to their floor and reached by nothing;
    `pool` is the argument that closes it.

    Each pooled path becomes an arm named by its file stem. Nothing about
    comparability is decided here: `_respondent_grid` applies the same four
    guards `compare` applies -- `label_versions_comparable`,
    `models_comparable`, `venue_comparable`, `skill_versions_comparable` -- and
    pooling is the stronger claim of the two, so a refusal from any of them
    stops the whole table rather than dropping one arm. Dropping would move the
    denominator the caller named and print a number anyway.
    `venue_comparable` is what makes the entry's exclusion of `verdicts-in-situ`
    mechanical: every row there is stamped `in_situ: true`.
