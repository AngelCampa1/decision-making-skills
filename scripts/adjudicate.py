"""Track N3: blind label adjudication for a trigger corpus.

**The check that has never run here.** Twenty-one of twenty-one scored failures
across three corpora were the answer key rather than the model, and version 3
multiplies the key's surface area by roughly fifty: a 1,200-word turn has fifty
times as many places to be wrong about what is being asked, and the error would
be *correlated with the independent variable*, so long items would look harder
because their labels are worse.

**Blind means blind.** Each adjudicator sees the turn and the skill's own
`Abort if` clauses. It does not see my label, my `why`, the case id, the band,
the triple, or the other adjudicators. Three independent instances per turn,
each in its own isolated conversation with a fresh working directory.

**The resolution rule is mechanical and is fixed before the run**, per the plan
in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-13-trigger-corpus-v3.md`:

* unanimous agreement with my label -> keep
* 2-of-3 against me -> the label moves, and the notebook says which and why
* 3-way split is impossible on a binary question, so its analogue here is a
  2-1 split *agreeing* with me, which keeps the label and is recorded as contested

**Pre-registered kill: more than 20% of labels moving retires the corpus.** That
is the falsifier most likely to fire, and it is checked by
:func:`adjudication_outcome` rather than by anybody's judgement after the fact.

This script scores nothing about model quality. It compares one set of labels
against another set of labels, which is the one comparison that does not require
deciding a response was wrong.
