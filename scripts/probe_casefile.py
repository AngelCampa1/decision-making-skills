"""Phase 0 probe for the casefile venue.

Deliberately outside ``decision_evals``. This exists to answer one question --
*can the control arm fail here at all* -- before any schema, generator, scorer or
golden file is built around the venue. The last two corpora were scaled, pinned
and fingerprinted before anyone checked that, and both turned out to measure
nothing. A throwaway script that answers it in a day is worth more than a correct
abstraction over a dead venue.

So the casefiles are hand-authored YAML with hand-written ground truth, the
parser is local, and none of it is reused. What survives Phase 0 is the *finding*,
not the code.

Two gates, both on the control arm:

1. **Admissibility below 0.85.** Above that there is no headroom.
2. **A non-zero trap rate at order >= 2.** A venue where the model never falls
   for a second-order trap cannot measure a forward-simulation skill, however
   hard it is in other respects.

Usage:
    python -m uv run python scripts/probe_casefile.py [--model haiku] [--case ID]
