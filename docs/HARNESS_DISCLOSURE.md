# Harness disclosure

**Audience:** the evaluating reader, and anyone trying to reproduce a run here.

**What this is.** The harness configuration every run in this repository records
against the ETCSOVG checklist, and the reason each field is on the list.

Harness choice can move a result by more than model choice does. In the
controlled 3×3 factorial
that arXiv:2605.23950 runs on "a difficulty-stratified 100-task subset of
SWE-bench Verified", two runs per cell, the aggregate harness-to-model variance
ratio was 7.80×, with ranking reversals in "6 out of 9
model-pair/harness-pair comparisons" (§4.2 and Table 2; those figures are in
the paper's body, not its abstract, and `paper/refs.bib` carries the verbatim
body text in a `quote_body` field). Harness-Bench (arXiv:2605.27922) separately
runs 5,194 execution trajectories over 106 sandboxed tasks across
"representative harness configurations" and "multiple model backends", and
finds "substantial variation in completion, process quality, efficiency, and
failure behavior across model-harness pairings", which is its abstract's own
wording, and qualitative rather than a magnitude. An agent result reported
without its harness is not reproducible, and most published ones are not.

The 7.80× is narrower than it looks, and the narrowing belongs in the same
breath as the figure: it is one estimate from one 3×3 design on one task
distribution. What it supports is the direction. It is not a constant to carry
into another setting, and this file does not use it as one.

The independent variable here is a markdown file and the model is held fixed,
which makes the harness the largest thing in the room. So it is nailed down and
written down.

## Preconditions

A replicator must verify that the CLI can actually authenticate, because
`claude auth status` will not tell them.

The harness's first claimed property is that it runs on a consumer subscription
with no API key. That rests on an assumption worth stating as one: that a
subscription-authed CLI invoked as a subprocess will authenticate. It can fail
while every visible indicator says otherwise. Observed on 2026-08-10:

```
$ claude auth status
{"loggedIn": true, "authMethod": "claude.ai", "subscriptionType": "max"}

$ claude -p "Say OK" --model haiku --output-format json
{"is_error": true, "api_error_status": 401,
 "result": "Failed to authenticate. API Error: 401 OAuth access token has been revoked."}
```

`loggedIn: true` is read from local state and is not validated against the
server, so it means only that a credential file exists. A token rotated by a
login elsewhere is revoked rather than expired, and no refresh recovers it. The
fix is `claude auth login`.

Two consequences are built into the runner rather than left to the operator:

1. Preflight. Every run makes one throwaway call before item 1 and aborts on
   a 401. A confirmation run is checkpointed and resumable across days precisely
   because rate limits are the budget, which means a token can rotate *between*
   sessions of a single run.
2. Triage. `authentication` is an explicit subtype of the
   infrastructure-error category in the zero-score classification, so a run that
   silently loses its credential is never recorded as a few hundred model
   failures.

## The record

Every run writes `results/<skill>/<date>-<sha7>/config.json` containing the
fields below. The analysis refuses to aggregate runs whose harness fields differ,
so a mid-experiment change surfaces as an error rather than as noise.

### E: Execution

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Agent | Claude Code CLI, non-interactive (`claude -p`). Every trigger and Track H number. Two further backends are disclosed separately below: `providers/openai_compatible.py` from 2026-08-19, an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server, which carries the five-arm evolution study of 2026-08-27 and every NVIDIA Build screen; and `providers/antigravity.py` from 2026-08-21, the Antigravity CLI, `screen` arena only, which has produced nothing published |
| CLI version | Recorded per run |
| Resolved model id | Recorded per run from `--output-format json` |
| Auth | Subscription OAuth. No API key. `--bare` is unusable: its help states auth is strictly `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`apiKeyHelper` and OAuth is never read. See *Preconditions* below; this is the harness's most fragile assumption |
| Sampling parameters | Not exposed. No temperature control; see [`LIMITATIONS.md`](LIMITATIONS.md) |
| Repeats | ≥2 independent runs per cell; variance reported |
| Working directory | A fresh temporary directory per call, outside `D:\code`, via `providers.claude_code.isolated_cwd`. The CLI's auto-memory path is keyed on cwd, so a shared directory would let one call's state reach the next |
| Temp-directory cleanup | Errors ignored. On Windows the CLI subprocess does not reliably release its cwd before the directory is removed, and a 365-call run died at call 348 with `WinError 32`, raised by the cleanup, after every call had succeeded. Leaked directories are left for the OS to reclaim |

**The second backend, disclosed separately because it is a different harness.**
That is the whole finding of the two papers above: a result reported without its
harness is not reproducible, so folding a local server into the table above
would be the error this document exists to avoid.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Agent | An OpenAI-compatible HTTP server. Ollama first; the same module reaches vLLM, LM Studio and `llama.cpp` |
| Arena | Per model prefix, enforced in code. `ollama` is `dev` and emits no verdict; the `nvbuild/` prefixes registered on 2026-08-26 are `screen`. One backend, two tiers, because the tier is a property of the weights answering rather than of the transport |
| Resolved model id | Recorded per call from the response's `model` field, prefixed with the server label |
| Auth | None locally. A bearer token where an endpoint wants one |
| Sampling parameters | **Exposed**, unlike the CLI, and defaulted to `temperature=0` |
| Cost | `0.0`, recorded rather than omitted. Local inference bills nothing and consumes no subscription quota, and the free hosted tier reports nothing to bill. A run on either is guarded by call count and wall clock, because a dollar cap that reads zero on every call cannot fire |
| Working directory | Not applicable. Nothing reads the filesystem |
| Isolation receipt | The model card from Ollama's native `/api/show`, refused when it carries a `SYSTEM` prompt. A Modelfile `SYSTEM` line is the local analogue of a planted `CLAUDE.md`. Where a server offers no card, the absence of a receipt is recorded and is **not** reported as a receipt that passed |
| Residency | Pinned at `keep_alive: 60m` since 2026-08-27, sent on every request by the provider that builds them. A probe that day found two items answering deterministically to whether the model had just been loaded, which would have put a venue artifact inside the study's A/A control. **Not written into the run manifest**, so a replicator reads it from the provider source; corrected 2026-08-28, this row claimed it was recorded per pass |
| No receipt from the hosted tier | NVIDIA Build offers no model card, so no receipt is obtainable there. That is recorded as *no receipt obtainable* and never as *isolation verified* |
| In-situ arm | **Refused.** There is no pre-existing system prompt to append to, so the call would be the isolated arm under another arm's label |
| Reasoning output | Returned in a field separate from the answer and **recorded**. Measured on `qwen3:4b`, 2026-08-19: 277 completion tokens for a `content` of `"4"`, the other 276 in `reasoning` |

**The `cot` arm is not safely measurable against a reasoning model, and that is
a live threat to any grid run here.** `solvers/arms.py` compares a
chain-of-thought arm against the others by asking for reasoning in the prompt.
A reasoning model reasons whether or not it is asked, and emits the chain in its
own field. So on `qwen3:4b` the `cot` and `off` arms would differ in what the
prompt requested and not in what the model did, which is the same defect as
running the in-situ arm here: two arms with one meaning, and nothing downstream
able to separate them.

Two things follow. Token counts and scored text describe different objects
whenever `reasoning` is non-empty, so the p90/p99 figures this document commits
to reporting must be split by whether a chain was emitted or they will read as
inflated. And any `dev`-arena grid involving `cot` needs either a non-reasoning
tag or a pre-registered decision about what the arm means there. Neither has
been made; nothing has been measured on this backend.

**The third backend, disclosed separately for the same reason, and it is the one
where the reason bites hardest.** The other two are ways of reaching a model.
This one is a coding agent: the question arrives inside a working agent's
context, and no flag takes that away. Folding it into either table above would
report an agent's behaviour as a model's.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Agent | Antigravity CLI (`agy`) 1.1.12, non-interactive (`agy --print`), `providers/antigravity.py`, from 2026-08-21 |
| Arena | `screen` only, for **every** model it serves, however capable. The venue cannot support a verdict, so the tier of the weights does not enter into it |
| Vendors | Three from one binary: Google (Gemini 3.1–3.7), Anthropic (Claude Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6), OpenAI (GPT-OSS 120B) |
| Resolved model id | From the `init` event, recorded with an `agy/` namespace. The namespace is load-bearing: `agy` serves a model it calls `claude-opus-4-6` and `claude -p` accepts that id too, so a bare record could not say which venue answered |
| Auth | Subscription OAuth, interactive-only. No API key. A signed-out machine fails every call in a run, which is why `preflight` runs before item 1 |
| Sampling parameters | Not exposed. `--effort` exists but is never passed; the effort level is pinned inside the model id instead, because two ways to set one parameter is how a run ends up not knowing what it ran |
| **Context overhead** | **~14k input tokens on every call, before the item.** Measured 2026-08-21 on a six-word prompt: 13,742 tokens on `gemini-3.7-flash-low`, 15,750 on `claude-sonnet-4-6`. This is the disclosure that matters most here — the artefact under test is roughly 1% of what the model reads |
| Tools | **57, always enabled**, at `permission_mode: "request-review"`. There is no `--tools` equivalent. Pinned as `AGY_TOOLS` and asserted per call; drift in either direction raises `IsolationError`. Identical set across vendors |
| Cost | `0.0`, recorded rather than omitted, on the same convention as the local backend. `agy` reports no cost field at all |
| Quota | **Unknown and not estimated.** Antigravity publishes no figure found; ~20 exploratory calls did not reach one. The first arm will discover it, and the checkpoint makes that recoverable |
| Working directory | A fresh temporary directory per call, via `isolated_cwd`, and asserted against the `init` event's `cwd` |
| Isolation receipt | The `init` event: resolved model, working directory and the full tool list, all three asserted. Not a capability list to be read — a mismatch stops the run |
| Context files | `GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/rules/*.md` planted in the working directory did **not** reach the response, verified against a positive control that did. See `notebook/2026-08-21-the-agy-backend-and-two-canaries.md` |
| Response contract | No `--system-prompt` exists, so the contract travels either as an enforced `--json-schema` or as prose at the top of the user message. **Recorded per row as `contract`, and which one is used is a registered arm rather than a formatting choice** |
| Schema dialect | Narrower than JSON Schema, and a refused schema fails the whole call. `{"type": ["string","null"], "enum": [..., null]}` errors; `{"type": "string", "enum": [...], "nullable": true}` answers |
| Call status | Recorded per row. A call can return `status: "ERROR"` **carrying a valid answer** — observed when the agent reached outside its sandbox after answering. Whether such a verdict may be scored is an open analysis decision |
| In-situ arm | **The only arm available.** Every row is stamped `in_situ: true` regardless of the flag, because there is no system prompt to replace and the host agent's own is always present |
| Concurrency | **Unmeasured**, which is not the same as safe. Serial only |

### T: Tools

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Tools | `--tools ""`, none |
| Slash commands | `--disable-slash-commands` |
| MCP | `--strict-mcp-config --mcp-config '{"mcpServers":{}}'` |
| Settings sources | `--setting-sources ""`, the load-bearing isolation control. Measured: a planted `CLAUDE.md` is still injected under a full `--system-prompt` replacement, and this flag alone blocks it. See [the canary ablation](../notebook/2026-08-10-isolation-canary.md) |
| Other skills | Excluded by the empty settings sources; asserted by test |
| Isolation receipt | The CLI's `system`/`init` event, parsed and asserted per conversation. Carries the tool list, the skill list, declared agents, memory file paths, the API-key source, the resolved model and the cwd |

The skill under test is the only intervention. Anything else in scope would be a
confound, and the tool budget is zero so that "the agent looked it up" can never
be an explanation for a difference between arms.

The receipt is a stronger control than the flags. Every row
above it describes what was *requested*. The `init` event describes what the CLI
actually loaded, and the two can differ: a flag can be renamed, deprecated, or
silently ignored by a version bump, and nothing in a passing run would show it.
`InitReceipt.assert_isolated()` raises if any tool or any skill is present.

It is asserted once per conversation rather than once per run. A receipt that
changed partway through a multi-turn item is exactly the confound the check
exists for, and a per-run assertion cannot see it.

There are two disclosed gaps in the receipt. It does *not* raise on declared
sub-agents, because Track B deliberately runs them; an arm that should have none
must check that field itself. And a receipt only reports what the CLI chose to
put in the event: absence of a field is not evidence of absence of the thing.

### C: Context

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| System prompt | `--system-prompt`, a full replacement, arm-specific |
| In-situ arm | `--append-system-prompt` on top of the default prompt |
| Session persistence | `--no-session-persistence`. Every item is a cold start. It does *not* prevent multi-turn; see below |
| Multi-turn transport | `--input-format stream-json` with `--output-format stream-json --verbose`. Turns are written to one live subprocess's stdin and context carries in-process |
| Prompt delivery | stdin, always. Never an argv element: Windows caps a command line near 32 KB and a 100k-token casefile is ~400 KB, so every long call would have died as a `CliError` and been triaged as infrastructure |
| `CLAUDE.md` discovery | Blocked by the scratch cwd, and proven by a canary test rather than assumed |
| Item rendering | Byte-exact prompt text published with results, per Biderman et al. (arXiv:2405.14782) |

The canary test plants a `CLAUDE.md` containing a distinctive, harmless
instruction in the runner's working directory, and asserts the model does not
follow it. Isolation that is merely configured is isolation that will silently
break; this makes it a failing test instead.

It ships with a positive control that asserts the same instruction *is*
followed without the isolation flag. A canary that cannot fire proves nothing,
and an isolation test that quietly stopped working would be worse than none: it
would license exactly the confidence it no longer earns.

The ablation behind the table above is why `--system-prompt` is listed as an
experimental control and not as an isolation mechanism. Replacing the system
prompt governs what the model is *told*; it does not govern what the model
*discovers*.

`--no-session-persistence` does not make multi-turn impossible, and reading it
that way would have killed a whole track. It blocks the *cross-process*
channel: `--resume` cannot pick a session back up, and there is no transcript on
disk between calls. Turns delivered to a single live process over
`--input-format stream-json` are unaffected, because the accumulation happens
inside that process and never touches persistence. Verified live rather than
argued: across three turns the prompt grew 179 → 334 → 422 tokens and turn three
recalled a nonce word planted in turn one.

The distinction is worth stating precisely because the disclosure above says
"every item is a cold start" and that remains true. Items are cold starts;
turns within an item are not, and are not meant to be.

### S: Scheduling

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Concurrency | Serial within a cell, and every published number was produced that way. `run_arm` gained a concurrent path on 2026-08-19 and it defaults to 1 |
| Arm ordering | **Blocks, not interleaved.** `runner.iter_items` returns item-major pairs and nothing in production calls it. Corrected 2026-08-28; this row read "arms interleaved per item so quota drift cannot align with an arm" until the paper's appendix was written against the code |
| Checkpointing | Resumable across sessions: rate limits, not dollars, are the budget |
| Ordering | Item order seeded and recorded |
| Wall-clock | Recorded but not a metric, since it is not comparable across days on a shared quota |

Interleaving matters more than it looks. A run that completes all `off` items on
Monday and all `on` items on Tuesday confounds the arm with everything that
changed in between, including the served model. **The five-arm study did exactly
that**, over hours rather than days, and its A/A pass is what bounds the damage:
the control arm repeated 1,456 calls later returned 728 of 728 items identical.
That is a measurement of the exposure on a local server, and it does not carry
to a hosted one.

**Concurrency is refused on the one backend where it was measured, and the
measurement was run twice.** 40 items, three ways, on `ollama/qwen3:4b` at
`temperature=0`. Within a single process invocation a serial repeat agreed with
serial on the exact text of 31 of 40 items and then 13 of 40, while the
concurrent pass at `concurrency=8` agreed on 0 of 40 both times. `input_tokens`
matched exactly on all 40 items in the second measurement and on 39 of 40 in the
first, the exception being an infrastructure zero that recorded no tokens at
all. So the prompts were byte-identical wherever a call was actually made, and
the change is the server's: batching concurrent requests changes the reduction
order, and a reasoning chain thousands of tokens long gives one flipped token
room to propagate. The cleanest form of the comparison holds elapsed time
fixed by pairing *adjacent* arms: at the same ~23 minute separation,
serial-vs-serial is 0.775 and 0.325 while serial-vs-concurrent is 0.000 twice.
`runner.CONCURRENCY_UNSAFE` refuses the combination rather than recording it
here and hoping.

**The `dev` arena does not reproduce its own text across runs, and that is the
larger disclosure.** Serial runs in different invocations agree on only 0 of 40
and 7 of 40 across the two available pairs. So no two runs on this backend may
be compared by exact text, whatever their concurrency, and the serial repeat
itself is not a rate: agreement falls in one contiguous block of each run, so
0.775 and 0.325 are two locations of a change-point reported as though they
were two estimates of a proportion. On the parsed answer, which is what reaches
a published number, every pairing lands between 0.825 and 0.975, and the
concurrent arms are not separable from cross-run serial variation at n=40.
Treat `dev`-arena agreement below roughly ten points as noise until somebody
measures the run-to-run band properly.

The Claude CLI backend has **not** been measured either way, and unmeasured is
not safe. Any future grid that wants concurrency on it needs its own falsifier
first, against its own serial floor. Recorded in
[`notebook/2026-08-19-concurrency-changes-every-answer-on-a-batching-server.md`](../notebook/2026-08-19-concurrency-changes-every-answer-on-a-batching-server.md)
and corrected in
[`notebook/2026-08-19-the-replication-moved-the-floor-and-found-a-worse-problem.md`](../notebook/2026-08-19-the-replication-moved-the-floor-and-found-a-worse-problem.md).

### O: Observability

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Output format | `--output-format json`, which returns `total_cost_usd`, `usage`, resolved model id |
| Answer contract | `--json-schema` |
| Transcripts | Full transcripts published, not just scores |
| Token accounting | Input and output tokens per item; medians and p90/p99 reported. "Input" means `input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens`; see below |
| Cache split | The three components are kept separately as well as summed |

Tail percentiles are reported because the AGENTS.md impact study
(arXiv:2601.20404) found the benefit of an instruction artifact concentrates in a
small number of expensive runs rather than spreading uniformly. A mean-only report
can hide the entire effect.

`usage.input_tokens` is not the prompt, and this disclosure would have been
wrong by three orders of magnitude without saying so. It is the *uncached
remainder*. A 380 KB casefile reported 10 input tokens while
`cache_creation_input_tokens` carried the other 24,285 and the cost tracked the
real figure. Reporting `input_tokens` alone would have put ~10 in the token
column of every long item, and the error would have grown with prompt length,
so it would have been correlated with the independent variable in exactly the
stratum this section exists to describe.

There are two things the cache is not. It is not a transcript channel: across a
verified three-turn conversation `cache_read_input_tokens` measured 0 on
every turn while context demonstrably carried, so cache reads are not the
mechanism by which turns accumulate and their absence is not evidence that they
did not. And it is not a change in what was sampled: on a second repeat of an
item the identical prompt arrives as `cache_read`, which moves cost without
moving the observation. That is why the split is published rather than only the
sum: a cost difference between two repeats of one item is a billing artifact,
and a reader given only `total_cost_usd` could not tell.

### V: Verification

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Ground truth | Computed from template rules, never authored |
| Verifier | Deterministic code where the answer is objective |
| Verifier testing | Fixtures of known-correct, known-wrong, paraphrased, and boundary responses, run before the verifier is trusted |
| Zero-score triage | Every zero classified as agent failure / verifier defect / environment leak / infrastructure error |
| Judges | Secondary metrics only; binary verdict plus written critique; TPR and TNR reported separately |

### G: Governance

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Pre-registration | `preregistration/<skill>-v<n>.yaml`, committed before the run |
| Hash locks | `skill_sha256` and `analysis_script_sha256` both verified at run start |
| Arena | `dev` / `screen` / `confirm`; only `confirm` emits a verdict, and only `confirm` is hash-locked |
| Stopping rule | Fixed N, no interim analysis |
| Attribution | Commits attributed to Angel Campa via GitHub noreply; enforced by `de check` |

## What this does not cover

Disclosure is not control. Recording the resolved model id does not protect
against a silent server-side change within the same id; recording that sampling
parameters are unavailable does not make the runs deterministic. The checklist
makes the configuration reproducible and the gaps visible. The gaps themselves
are in [`LIMITATIONS.md`](LIMITATIONS.md).
