# Contributing

**Audience:** someone about to send a change.

A research project with a product attached. Almost every rule here is enforced
by `de check`, so the gate tells you what it wants and you rarely have to
remember anything. This page covers what it will refuse, the research rules no
gate can check, and how to change a skill, a document, or the website.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.13+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
uv sync --group dev
```

That installs the Python side. `de check` also needs the `claude` CLI on `PATH`
for the plugin-manifest step, and `de site` needs Node and npm. Publishing the
website needs nothing extra beyond those, because publishing no longer happens
here.

```bash
uv run de check
```

That is the whole gate: lint, format, types, tests, coverage floors, and the
repository-integrity checks tabled below. It is bound to `pre-commit` (fast subset) and
`pre-push` (everything), and the same command runs in CI on every pull request
and every push to `main`. Run it before you believe anything works.

Run it locally anyway, even though CI will. The two are not redundant: local
tells you the tree in front of you passes, CI tells you the commit passes, and
the first time those were compared, on a locally simulated clean clone, they
disagreed in four places.

`de check` makes no model calls and is fully deterministic.

## What the gates will refuse

| If you | `de check` says |
| --- | --- |
| commit under a `@ventoralabs.com` address, or with `user.name` or `user.email` unset | the history *is* the pre-registration evidence, and a misattributed commit cannot be rewritten later without destroying the timestamps the method relies on |
| change `datasets/triggers/`, `datasets/tailoring/`, `skills/` or `evals/src/decision_evals/arenas.py` without an entry in [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md) | a label move is invisible in a checkpoint and shifts every number already computed from it, and the arena registry decides which runs may become evidence |
| publish a run without an answer-key version, or with a prediction that cannot be shown to predate its data | a prediction that cannot be shown to predate its data is not evidence |
| give a module a coverage floor that no entry point reaches | a tested refusal with no caller is inert, and the gate reports green either way |
| name a `de` command, path, or component that does not exist | documentation was the last obligation here checked by reading it, and the README was found naming two commands that never existed |
| add a document under `docs/` without listing it in [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) | that page is the index and the site's `/docs/` landing page, so a document missing from it is a document nobody reads |
| write a living document with no `**Audience:**` line | four audiences want different things from a page, and one serving two serves neither |
| leave a document under a `docs/` subdirectory that nothing links to | the first run of that check found 315 lines of drafted procedure reachable only by listing the directory |
| edit a generated region by hand, or open one no renderer answers to | run `de sync`; four documents said the harness had four arms while the code had five, and every path in all four sentences resolved |
| point a `de:fact` marker at a figure the register does not declare, or put one inside the claim's own source | a figure pinned to nothing drifts, and a marker on the source sentence would let `de sync` rewrite the very line the anchor exists to check |
| leave a living document more than ten commits past its recorded review | run `de drift`; it names the documents whose paths have moved and prints the line to paste back once you have read one |
| add a collection to [`site/inputs.json`](site/inputs.json) missing a field one of its three readers needs | that file is the single declaration of what the site renders; it was three restatements kept in step by a comment, and two of them had already drifted |
| leave [`docs/RUN_INDEX.md`](docs/RUN_INDEX.md) stale | run `de index`; it is generated so it cannot drift the way a hand-maintained index does |
| edit a document the website renders without rebuilding it | run `de site`; the site reads this repository's markdown in place, so an edited document is a published page that disagrees with the repository until somebody notices |
| regenerate a golden file without `pytest --bless` | a benchmark that changes silently makes every earlier number incomparable with every later one |

## The research rules

These are not enforceable by a gate, and they matter more than the ones that are.

- Predictions go in [`notebook/`](notebook/) before runs. Dated, one file per
  entry, `YYYY-MM-DD-a-sentence-about-what-happened.md`.
- The notebook is append-only. If a prediction turns out wrong, the entry says
  so: append a `Correction` block, never edit it away. This has been checked
  mechanically and is holding.
- A registered band names its estimator and its denominator, not just its
  number. If you cannot write the sentence "we will compute X from records Y
  over denominator Z using function W", the run is not ready.
- A recall band is set against the observed per-item ceiling, not a round
  number. Compute the ceiling from the per-item history first.
- Before believing an outcome, check that some possible response would have
  scored above zero for that arm. An estimator that cannot return a non-zero
  value is not a measurement, and it does not announce itself. This repository
  has shipped four of them, every one producing a clean run and a plausible
  number.

[`docs/AUTONOMOUS_WORK_ORDER.md`](docs/AUTONOMOUS_WORK_ORDER.md) has the rules
for running unattended. [`docs/PROTOCOL.md`](docs/PROTOCOL.md) is the standing
methodology.

## Writing

[`docs/VOICE.md`](docs/VOICE.md) is the standard, and it governs everything:
documents, skill bodies, and the comments and docstrings in the source. Read it
before you write. Run the humanizer skill, which applies to drafting as much as
to editing. Then hand the result to a different agent or person, briefed with
[`docs/reviews/HOUSE_STYLE.md`](docs/reviews/HOUSE_STYLE.md) and
[`docs/reviews/POSITIONING.md`](docs/reviews/POSITIONING.md).

It applies to what you write, going forward. Bring a comment up to standard when
you change it. Do not sweep the source for style, and do not restyle a document
you are not otherwise working on.

Nothing enforces any of this. The gates read whether a reference resolves,
whether the index agrees with the directory, whether a document names its
audience, and whether the tables and figures it derives still match what they
derive from. They decline to judge the sentence around any of them, on purpose,
so the review is the only thing between a draft and the repository.

Where a new document goes, and which of the classes below it belongs to, is
[`docs/DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md`](docs/DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md).

Four kinds of file need a specific reading of that rule:

- **Dated records** say what was true on the day somebody wrote them:
  [`notebook/`](notebook/), [`results/`](results/),
  [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md), [`docs/STATUS.md`](docs/STATUS.md)
  and [`docs/superpowers/plans/`](docs/superpowers/plans/). New entries meet the
  standard. Old ones are left alone, because a record rewritten for style is a
  record destroyed.
- **Generated files** are fixed at their source. Editing
  [`docs/RUN_INDEX.md`](docs/RUN_INDEX.md), `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/skills/` or
  `plugin/skills/` is reverted by the next build, so fix
  [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and the generators instead.
- **Agent-facing files** get the standard plus a stricter one of their own:
  imperative mood, one rule per bullet, and the reasoning moved out to
  [`docs/WHY_THESE_RULES.md`](docs/WHY_THESE_RULES.md). A paragraph of
  justification in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) is context spent on every session
  forever.
- **`skills/decision-making/SKILL.md`'s description field** is the artefact the
  trigger runs measure. Editing it for style makes every published number
  incomparable, so it changes only as a deliberate new arm with an entry in
  [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md). The procedure bodies around it are
  ordinary prose and get the ordinary standard.

The pass never touches a number, a citation, a correction a gate register
depends on, or a hedge carrying its own weight. *"We have not shown this works"*
never gets shortened into *"this does not work"*.
[`docs/VOICE.md`](docs/VOICE.md) states all three prohibitions in full.

## Changing a skill

`skills/` is the source. `.agents/skills/` and `CLAUDE.md` are generated
mirrors, so edit [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and the files under `skills/`, then:

```bash
uv run de mirror
```

`de check` gates their agreement, so a hand-edited mirror fails the build.

A skill may not enter `plugin/skills/` while it carries `UNTESTED` or
`WITHDRAWN`. That is the promotion gate and it is enforced by `de lint`.

## Changing a document the website renders

Every markdown file under `docs/`, `notebook/`, `results/`, `skills/` and the
repository root is rendered by the site *in place*. Nothing is copied, so no
second version of a document exists to disagree with the first. The price is
that each build is a snapshot with an expiry nobody can see. Rebuild in the
same change:

```bash
uv run de sync && uv run de site
```

`de sync` fills the generated regions and the pinned figures; `de site` then
writes `site/build-manifest.json`, which records a hash of every file the site
renders. Run them in that order, because a region `de sync` rewrites is a file
the manifest has to hash. Commit both with the document. If you touched
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) or `skills/`, `de mirror` comes first: `CLAUDE.md` is
itself a site input.

Publishing is not your job any more. Merging to `main` deploys the site through
[`.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml), and
nothing on a laptop can publish. That gate still cannot see the live page,
because `de check` is offline by design, so the question is asked separately
when you want the answer:

```bash
uv run de deployed
```

## Reporting that a skill does not work

This is the most useful thing you can send. The verdict vocabulary in
[`SCORECARD.md`](SCORECARD.md) has room for `NULL` and `HARMFUL`, and the
retirement rule exists because evidence that cannot come out negative is not
evidence. If a procedure produced a worse answer than thinking directly, open an
issue and say so.

## Scope

Send the skill and the measurement together. A pull request that adds a skill
without a way to test it opens a conversation about how to test it, because
building that feedback loop is the entire premise here. *"We have not shown this
works"* and *"this works"* are different statements, and keeping them apart is
the job.
