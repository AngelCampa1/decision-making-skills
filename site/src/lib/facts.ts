/* What this site says about the skill, read from the skill.
 *
 * Every fact here used to be typed twice: once in `skills/decision-making/`
 * and once in a page. On 2026-08-19 `council.md` and `hinge.md` shipped and
 * two pages went on saying "four procedures" -- one of them the social card
 * every link preview uses. Nothing noticed, because nothing could: `docs.py`
 * scans `*.md` and `docs/*.md` and never opens a `.astro` file, and `site.py`
 * hashes the page for staleness without reading a word of it.
 *
 * So the page no longer holds the list. It asks for it, and the build stops if
 * the answer disagrees with the skill.
 *
 * The list comes from SKILL.md's routing table rather than from a directory
 * listing, and that is the load-bearing choice. The table is what an agent
 * actually routes from, so a control arm is excluded because it is not in the
 * table and says so in its own frontmatter. A control must never be advertised
 * as a procedure, and no page holds a list of which files those are.
