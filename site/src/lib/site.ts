/**
 * What this site is, in one sentence.
 *
 * The `WebSite` node of every page's structured data carries it, so it is the
 * site-level answer rather than any page's, and `Doc.astro` falls back to it
 * for a document whose body yields no summary. Same rule as above: no measured
 * number.
 *
 * It read `placebo-controlled` until 2026-08-20. The placebo arm was written and
 * `check_placebo_match` sized it on every gate run, and at that point no
 * published run had used it, so the present indicative claimed a control that
 * had never stood in for anything. The five-arm study of 2026-08-27 has since
 * used it as its registered control. Arms belong here as a design or not at all.
