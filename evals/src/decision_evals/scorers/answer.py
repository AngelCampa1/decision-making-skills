"""Answer parsing and scoring.

Harbor's discipline, adopted wholesale: the verifier is tested against fixtures
of known-correct, known-wrong, paraphrased and boundary responses *before* it is
trusted, and every zero score is classified rather than assumed to be a model
failure. A verifier defect and a model failure look identical in the aggregate,
and only one of them is a finding.

Two parsing decisions are worth defending, because both cost us apparent
accuracy and both are deliberate.

**No fallback search.** When the ``ANSWER:`` line is missing, the response is a
parse failure even if an option is clearly named in the prose. Recovering it
would be easy and would corrupt the experiment: the format contract is in every
arm, so recovery rates would differ by arm in a way that has nothing to do with
decision quality, and the format-integrity guard would stop measuring anything.

**Ambiguity is a distinct outcome, not a coin flip.** A response naming two
options is not half correct. It is reported separately so it cannot be quietly
absorbed into either the numerator or the denominator.

#: Why an item scored zero. The first three are assigned automatically; the rest
#: require a human reading the trace, and exist so that "we did not look" is
#: distinguishable from "we looked and it was the model".
#:
#: ``agent_wrong`` is therefore **provisional until a trace is read**. On the
#: first full control run all fifteen zeros were automatically labelled
#: ``agent_wrong`` and all fifteen turned out to be ``item_defect`` -- the
#: model's answer was defensible and the ground truth was not. Treating the
#: automatic label as a finding would have reported a 5% agent error rate that
#: did not exist.
#:
#: ``item_defect`` is separate from ``verifier_defect`` on purpose. Harbor's
#: ontology assumes fixed tasks and folds both into the verifier, but here the
#: parser and the comparison were correct and the *item* was wrong, and the two
#: have completely different fixes: one is a code change, the other is a
