"""The run loop.

Checkpointed and resumable, because rate limits rather than dollars are the
budget and a confirmation run may span several days. Records append to JSONL as
they complete, and a resumed run skips item/arm pairs already present. Crashing
halfway through therefore costs the current call and nothing else.

Two behaviours are non-obvious and deliberate.

**Preflight before item 1.** A revoked credential returns a well-formed error on
every call, so without a preflight the run records a few hundred authentication
failures that are indistinguishable, in the results, from a model that got
everything wrong. That is not hypothetical -- it happened during the harness
spike, with ``claude auth status`` reporting ``loggedIn: true`` throughout.

**Arms interleave per item.** Running all of ``off`` and then all of ``on``
would confound the arm with everything that changed in between, including the
served model and the quota state. The loop's outer dimension is the item.

    Args:
        identity: Where these calls sit in a run tree. ``None`` for the
            single-call venue, which is what every run to date has been; the
            record's node columns then stay ``None``, which is the truth about
            such a run rather than a gap in it.
        expected_cost_usd: What to authorise per call. ``None`` -- the default --
            derives it from the length of the prompt actually about to be sent.
            The flat 0.05 this replaced under-counted a 100k-token casefile by
            roughly fivefold, and the ledger authorises *before* the call, so the
            shortfall would have surfaced as a run that stopped mid-stratum.
            Pass a number to pin it, which the budget tests do.
        concurrency: How many calls may be in flight. ``1`` -- the default --
            is the sequential loop every published run used, unchanged.
        backoff: How rate limits are waited out, shared across every worker.
            ``None`` uses :data:`DEFAULT_BACKOFF`. Concurrency does not create
            quota, so a closed window otherwise turns into ``concurrency``
            infrastructure zeros per batch as fast as the pool can produce them.
        candidate_sha: Identifies the body in ``arm.system_prompt`` when that
            body was generated rather than written. Recorded on every row, and
            it belongs in ``resume_fields`` whenever one checkpoint holds more
            than one candidate.
        resume_fields: The columns that identify a call for resume. The default
            is ``("item_id", "arm")``, which is what every checkpoint on disk
            carries and what every published run resumed on, so it is left
            alone: widening it by default would make :func:`completed_keys` skip
            every existing line for a missing column and silently re-run whole
            checkpoints. An evolution run passes
            ``("item_id", "arm", "candidate_sha", "seed")``, because there the
            first two identify a *set* of calls rather than one.
        measuring_concurrency: Permit ``concurrency > 1`` on a model listed in
            :data:`CONCURRENCY_UNSAFE`. Only the falsifier that populates that
            register may pass it: the register exists because such a run was
            measured to change every answer, and the one job that still needs to
            make those calls is the job that re-measures it.

    **Threads rather than asyncio, and it is a real choice.** A call is a
    subprocess or an HTTP request; both spend their whole life blocked on I/O
    with the GIL released, so a bounded pool saturates the backend exactly as
    well as an event loop would. Going async would mean an async :data:`CallFn`
    and an async rewrite of both providers, which is a large change to two
    modules at a 100% floor in exchange for nothing measurable. The same
    argument retires Ray and Dask one step earlier: there is no CPU work here to
    distribute.

    **Three things concurrency changes, stated because a checkpoint would not
    say.** Records are written in *completion* order rather than item order, so
    two runs over the same items need not produce byte-identical files; nothing
    downstream reads a checkpoint positionally, and resume is keyed on
    ``(item_id, arm)``. The budget is *reserved* at dispatch and released when
    the record arrives, so a window cannot authorise more than the limit allows.
    That is a correction, not a design note: charging only on completion meant
    every call in one window read the same balance, and six items at $0.02
    against a $0.021 limit ran all six while the serial path stopped after one.
    And when a run aborts, the batch that contained the failure is drained
    first, so calls that already succeeded and were already paid for are kept;
    only results still in flight are discarded, and resume re-runs those.

    **It was measured twice, and the second run narrowed what the first one
    licensed.** The prediction above was registered before this code existed.
    Within one invocation, concurrent-against-serial agreed on the exact text of
    0 of 40 items both times, against a serial repeat of 31 of 40 and 13 of 40,
    so :data:`CONCURRENCY_UNSAFE` refuses the combination. The sharpest form of
    that comparison is between *adjacent* arms, which controls for elapsed time:
    at the same ~23 minute separation, serial-vs-serial is 0.775 and 0.325 while
    serial-vs-concurrent is 0.000 twice. But cross-invocation serial agreement is
    itself only 0 of 40 and 7 of 40, so serial reproducibility is not a property
    this backend has either, and on the parsed answer nothing separates the arms
    at n=40. Every other backend is unmeasured, which is a different thing from
    safe.

    Returns:
        The records produced *by this invocation*. Records already on disk from
        an earlier run are not re-read, because the caller reads the checkpoint
        for analysis anyway and returning them would make the count misleading.

    Raises:
        RunError: An authentication failure, the budget was reached, or
            ``concurrency`` was not positive. The first two stop the run rather
            than being scored, and both leave the checkpoint intact so the run
            resumes where it stopped.
