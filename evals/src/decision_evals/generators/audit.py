"""The two-auditor distractor filter.

This is the most important gate in the dataset pipeline, because the premise of
the flagship skill depends on it. The original GSM-NoOp result reported a
collapse of up to 65% from a single irrelevant clause. A 2026 re-audit found
that most of those clauses were *ambiguous* rather than irrelevant -- material a
reasonable solver would fold into the calculation -- and after a two-auditor
filter kept 117 of 945 candidates (12.4%), the residual effect was
statistically indistinguishable from zero.

If our distractors are ambiguous in the same way, we would measure a real effect
and attribute it to the wrong cause: the model would not be failing to ignore
irrelevant information, it would be correctly incorporating information we had
mislabelled. So a distractor is admitted only if it clears two independent
checks.

**Check 1 is structural and proves invariance rather than sampling it.** A
distractor qualifies only if it shares no variables with the solution
expression. This is worth being precise about, because it would be easy to
overclaim here: the plan called for showing the computed solution is invariant to
the distractor's removal, and in this generator that is *trivially* true for
every fact. Answers are computed from sampled variables, never from fact text,
so an empirical remove-and-recompute test would pass for load-bearing facts too
and would prove nothing at all. The variable-overlap test is the version with
content -- it asks whether the distractor even mentions a quantity the answer
turns on, and a negative answer is a proof over all samplings rather than
evidence from some of them.

**Check 2 is semantic and needs judgement.** Structural independence does not
make a fact irrelevant to a *reader*. "The customer is on the Enterprise plan"
shares no variables with a refund-window calculation, but a reasonable solver
might treat it as grounds for discretion. Two independent auditors must agree
the fact is genuinely inert. Unanimity is required, so a single dissent rejects
-- the conservative direction, since the cost of a wrongly-admitted distractor is
a mismeasured headline effect and the cost of a wrongly-rejected one is a
template with fewer distractors.

Auditors are injected rather than constructed here, so the filter is testable
without model calls and ``de check`` stays free and deterministic.

:func:`corpus_fingerprint` sits at the end of the module for the same reason:
it is the check that the items a run resumed onto are the items it started
from. It lived in ``scripts/calibrate.py`` while one script was the only
caller. An evolution loop resumes a checkpoint per candidate, so it is now
library code, and a second copy of a hash function is a second answer.
