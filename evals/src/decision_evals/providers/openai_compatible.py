"""An OpenAI-compatible server as a model backend.

``docs/PROTOCOL.md`` §2 has declared a ``dev`` arena on ``Ollama`` since it was
written, and :mod:`decision_evals.arenas` has carried ``model_prefixes=("mockllm",
"ollama")`` for as long. Nothing was ever behind it. This is the backend.

**Why it is worth having, in programme terms.** Every call this repository has
ever made went through one Claude CLI on one subscription. Two consequences.
The claim ladder promises a sentence about "frontier models", plural, which one
family cannot support. And every instrument shakedown -- every falsifier run
against a known-good case, every check that some possible response would have
scored above zero -- spends quota, which is the binding budget here. A local
server costs nothing and has no quota, so the rules in
``docs/AUTONOMOUS_WORK_ORDER.md`` become cheap enough to always follow rather
than expensive enough to skip.

**Why OpenAI-compatible rather than Ollama-native.** The same wire format is
spoken by Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio and ``llama.cpp``'s server, so one module
reaches all of them and a second served model is configuration rather than a
new provider. Ollama is simply the first server pointed at. The native API
would be marginally tidier for exactly one of those and would have to be
rewritten for the rest.

**Why no HTTP dependency.** One POST of JSON. :mod:`decision_evals.corpora`
already fetches a 29 MB corpus with :mod:`urllib.request`, and a dependency
added for one request is a claim about the design that the code contradicts --
the note in ``pyproject.toml`` about the removed ``inspect-ai`` declaration is
this repository's own record of what that costs.

**Isolation is not free here, which was the surprise.** The reasoning that
almost shipped was: the Claude CLI needs :data:`~decision_evals.providers.claude_code.ISOLATION_FLAGS`
and a ``system``/``init`` receipt because it reads ``CLAUDE.md``, skills and MCP
config off disk, whereas an HTTP server reads nothing from the client's
filesystem, so the prompt is the whole context and isolation is structural.

The first half is right and the conclusion is wrong. An Ollama model is a
Modelfile, and a Modelfile may carry its own ``SYSTEM`` instruction and its own
prompt ``TEMPLATE``. A baked-in system prompt is exactly a planted ``CLAUDE.md``
one layer down: invisible in the request, present in every generation, and
attributable to the skill under test if nobody looks. ``qwen3`` and several
published tags ship non-empty templates as a matter of course.

So there is a receipt, and :func:`assert_isolated` asserts it. It reads
Ollama's native ``/api/show`` -- deliberately outside the OpenAI-compatible
surface, because the OpenAI surface cannot express the question -- and refuses
a model whose card carries a ``system`` prompt. For a server that is not Ollama
no equivalent exists, and :class:`Endpoint` makes the caller say so rather than
letting the silence pass for a pass. **Recording "no receipt was available" is
not the same as recording "isolation was verified", and the whole reason Track
0.3 forced the streaming transport onto every node was to stop those two being
confused.**

    """The context window each of a server's resident models is actually running with.

    Not the same question as "what context length does this model support".
    ``/api/show`` answers the architectural maximum -- 40,960 for ``qwen3`` --
    while a server loads with whatever ``OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH`` says, which
    defaults to **4,096**. The effective number is the one on the loaded
    instance, and ``/api/ps`` is where it is readable.

    The gap is not cosmetic. On 2026-08-27 two evolution runs sent
    ``max_tokens: 8192`` at a model loaded with a 4,096-token window, which is a
    request that has arranged not to be able to hold its own answer.

    **What that misconfiguration did is not established.** Of 478 readable
    answers not one ever crossed 4,096 prompt-plus-output tokens and every long
    unreadable one was past it, which reads as cause and is only correlation: a
    controlled probe at a 16,384-token window produced no unreadable answer in
    231 calls, and the same body at 4,096 produced none in 210. Widening the
    window does not reproduce the failure and neither does keeping it narrow.
    The refusal below stands on the incoherence rather than on the incident.

    Returns:
        Bare model name to context window, empty when the server has nothing
        loaded. A model absent from the mapping is not loaded, which is a
        different answer from a window of zero.
