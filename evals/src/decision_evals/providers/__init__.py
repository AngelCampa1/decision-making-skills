"""Model backends.

Two. The Claude Code CLI driven as a subprocess, which is every call this
repository has published; see ``docs/HARNESS_DISCLOSURE.md`` for why this
backend rather than ``inspect_swe``'s ``claude_code()`` solver, and
``notebook/2026-08-10-inspect-swe-spike-verdict.md`` for the spike that decided
it. And an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server, which is the ``dev`` arena
``docs/PROTOCOL.md`` §2 has declared since it was written.

They are not interchangeable and :mod:`decision_evals.arenas` is what stops them
being treated as though they were. A local model is free, unmetered and cannot
emit a verdict; the CLI is the only backend that reaches ``screen`` and
``confirm``. The shared surface is :class:`CliResult` and the two error types
:mod:`decision_evals.runner` catches, so a runner does not know which one it is
driving -- which is the point, and also the reason the arena gate is in code
rather than in a convention.
