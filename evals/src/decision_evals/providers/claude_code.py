"""The Claude Code CLI as a model backend.

Every generation in this repository goes through :func:`build_command`. The
point of routing it all through one function is that the isolation flags cannot
be forgotten at a call site: they are baked into :data:`ISOLATION_FLAGS` and
prepended unconditionally.

That matters more than it looks, because of a measured result recorded in
``notebook/2026-08-10-isolation-canary.md``. A ``CLAUDE.md`` planted in the
working directory is **still injected when the system prompt is fully
replaced**. Replacing the system prompt is not an isolation mechanism; it
governs a different injection path. The flag that actually blocks project memory
is ``--setting-sources ""``.

Anyone building this harness would reasonably assume ``--system-prompt``
(documented as a full replacement) removes everything. It does not, and the
failure is silent: runs would quietly inherit whatever ``CLAUDE.md`` happened to
sit above the working directory. On this machine that file mandates an unrelated
copy-editing workflow, which would have been a confound in every arm at once.

    Strictly better evidence than inferring isolation from a response. The CLI

    loaded and where it would write memory.

    **Two of these fields are latent rather than active, and the distinction
    matters.** Under ``--tools ""`` the CLI still *declares* its built-in
    subagents and an auto-memory path, but there is no Task tool to reach the
    agents and no memory tool to write the path — tested, nothing was created.
    Both go live the moment ``--tools`` is relaxed, which Track F plans. The
    memory path is keyed on the working directory, so it would become a
    cross-run state channel that a checkpointed record cannot see. Hence
    :meth:`assert_isolated` gates on ``tools`` and ``skills``, and the rest —
    ``agents``, ``memory_paths``, ``api_key_source``, ``model``, ``cwd``,
    ``session_id`` — is recorded rather than gated.

    **Why ``memory_paths`` specifically is recorded and not gated, checked

    ``tools`` and ``skills`` — empty under a healthy isolated call, so a

    """A live multi-turn session against one CLI subprocess.

    **This is the whole V2 venue, and it needed no flag relaxed.** Track 0's
    original reading was that ``--no-session-persistence`` blocked multi-turn.
    It does not: that flag blocks ``--resume``, which is *cross-process*. With
    ``--input-format stream-json`` the turns go to one live process's stdin and
    context carries in-process, under the full isolation stack.

    The falsifier written for this was also wrong and is worth keeping visible.
    It required ``cache_read`` to climb turn over turn; measured, ``cache_read``
    stayed at **0** on every turn while turn 3 recalled a codeword from turn 1.
    Caching is a billing optimisation, not a transcript mechanism. Run as
    written, that gate would have declared a healthy venue dead. The corrected
    signal is ``input_tokens`` climbing monotonically *plus* a behavioural
    recall check — two independent signals, because a longer question explains
    the first and a lucky guess explains the second.
