"""The experimental arms.

Four arms plus an ecological-validity fifth. The whole design rests on three
rules, and each is enforced here rather than left to whoever assembles a run.

**The response-format contract appears in every arm.** If only the treatment is
told to emit a structured answer, the experiment measures instruction-following
rather than decision quality, and the treatment wins for a reason that has
nothing to do with the skill. :data:`FORMAT_CONTRACT` is concatenated into every
arm's system prompt with no way to omit it.

**The option menu is held constant.** AgentAtlas found that removing explicit
option menus moved trajectory accuracy by 14-40pp across all eight models
tested -- larger than any effect we expect to measure. The menu lives in
:func:`render_item`, which is arm-independent, so it cannot vary by construction.

**The placebo is matched on tokens and structure.** A skill that beats ``off``
but not ``placebo`` is a length effect. :func:`check_placebo_match` refuses a
placebo that is not the right size, because an unmatched placebo is worse than
none: it looks like a control while silently failing to control for the thing it
exists to control for.

Wording follows the trust-framing result (arXiv:2603.14373), where trust-framed
system prompts surfaced 59% more hidden issues while fear-framing showed no gain
over unframed. Nothing here threatens the model with consequences.
