"""Citation validation.

Three misattributed numbers were written into this repository in a single
morning on 2026-08-11, all of them citing **real papers that existed and said
something adjacent**:

- ``+18 to +36pp`` was "corrected" to ``+16.6pp`` on the assumption that a
  search result describing "SkillsBench" was the paper already cited. Two
  different papers, both real.
- ``90% -> 13.6%`` was attributed to arXiv:2605.24050. That paper is *quoting*
  other authors, about **tool** selection, at **11,100** candidates. Its own
  number is 21% at 202 skills. The figure was then used to justify a design
  decision made at four skills.
- MAST's category percentages were reported as ``41.8 / 36.9 / 21.3``. Those
  numbers are not in the paper.

**A presence check would have caught none of them.** Every identifier resolved
and every paper was real. What was wrong was the number sitting next to the
identifier, so the check has to bind the two together: an assertion of the form
"*this figure*, per *this paper*" is only admissible when the bibliography
carries the sentence it came from.

Hence :data:`QUOTE_FIELD`. A ``quote`` field is a promise that someone opened
the paper, and it is checkable by a reader in a way that a bare identifier is
not. Adding one is a few seconds' work; the three errors above each survived
review and reached a file this repository calls the product.

The rule is deliberately narrow. An identifier cited in passing needs a
bibliography entry and nothing more. It is only when a **number** appears
alongside it that a verbatim quote becomes mandatory, because that is the only
construction in which the citation is doing arithmetic work.

**The baseline is where the known-unchecked claims are, and it is not neutral.**
On 2026-08-12 the eight baselined identifiers that assert a number were fetched
and read. Two were wrong: one paper's scale was another paper's, and one figure
was in no version of the paper it was attributed to. Six of eight is a better
rate than the morning that motivated this module, and it is not a rate anyone
should be comfortable exempting from a check. See
``notebook/2026-08-12-the-baseline-was-where-the-errors-were.md``.

**A ``quote`` field is not read against the number beside it**, and cannot be.
The gate checks that someone opened the paper; whether the sentence they copied
supports the figure is a judgement no regex makes. Resolving a baseline entry
therefore means reading what the identifier was cited *for*, not only what it is
— on 2026-08-12 that distinction was the difference between fixing a retracted
percentage and giving it a green tick.

**Until 2026-08-13 the scan was line-scoped, and this repository hard-wraps at
~80 columns.** A claim and the identifier it rests on therefore land on
different lines routinely, and the check never fired on any of them. The worst
case was in the file this repository calls the product: ``CLAUDE.md`` put "59%
more hidden issues" on one line and ``arXiv:2603.14373`` on the next, so the
gate that enforces standing rule 5 had never checked the product file's own
load-bearing citation. ``docs/AUTONOMOUS_WORK_ORDER.md`` — the document that
*states* standing rule 5 — carried the same claim across the same wrap.

The window is now the **markdown block the author wrote**: see :func:`blocks`.

**A field rename is a way to escape the check, and one was already in production
use.** Found 2026-08-14, during an adversarial review of this apparatus itself.
``paper/refs.bib``'s entry for arXiv:2605.23950 carries ``quote_body`` — added
2026-08-13 to hold the verbatim body-section text backing four numbers
(``7.80x``, ``13.0pp``, ``8.5pp``, ``6 out of 9``) that are not in that paper's
abstract. :func:`parse_bib`'s ``has_quote`` recognised exactly one name,
``quote``, so ``quote_body`` was invisible to it: the check did not read it as
evidence, and did not complain that it was unrecognised either. That entry
happened to pass anyway, because it *also* carries a plain ``quote`` field
(the abstract text, which contains no numbers at all) — the same
content-blind pass described above, not something ``quote_body`` caused. But
the field carrying the only real evidence for those four numbers was doing
zero enforcement work, and a future edit that dropped the redundant ``quote``
field (reasonable, if you didn't know the gate needed it) would have made the
entry fail silently in the safe direction — or, if the field were misnamed a
third way, failed to fail at all. Fixed by recognising :data:`QUOTE_BODY_FIELD`
explicitly and by refusing, loudly, any other field name that starts with
``quote`` — see :func:`check_unknown_quote_fields`. A rename cannot escape the
check unnoticed, whichever way it goes.

    **Why a block and not a line.** The scan used to require the claim number
    and the identifier on the same physical line. That is not a rule about
    prose, it is a rule about where the paragraph reflow happened to fall, and
    in a repository hard-wrapped at ~80 columns it exempted almost everything —
    including ``CLAUDE.md``'s own justification for how it is worded.

    **Why not a fixed line count either.** ``±n`` lines would be a number
    nobody derived, and standing rule 1 forbids inventing one. It would also be
    wrong in both directions at once: it reaches *across* a blank line into an
    unrelated paragraph, and it stops short inside a long one.

    So the window is the author's own block. A block ends at a blank line and
    at every structural boundary markdown defines: a heading, a thematic break
    or setext underline, a table row, a list item, a footnote or link
    definition, and a fenced code block — each tested after any blockquote
    marker is stripped. Those splits are what keep the rule from becoming a
    dragnet. A table of contents is a run of list items, so an identifier in
    one entry does not reach a number in the next; a comparison table gives
    every row its own scope, which is exactly where the per-row figures in
    ``CLAUDE.md`` live.

    **How wide that actually is, measured on the rule as implemented.** Over
    the governed corpus the splitter yields 4,785 blocks, but the only ones
    whose size can change an outcome are the 138 that contain a citation:
    **mean 4.2 lines, median 4, p90 8, max 18**. So the effective window is
    about four hard-wrapped lines — one paragraph — and it is bounded above by
    a real number rather than by a hope.

    Those figures replace an earlier derivation that was wrong in the way this
    repository keeps being wrong. It quoted **blank-line** blocks (mean 3.3,
    median 3) to justify a splitter that also splits on structure, and it
    quoted the all-blocks distribution, which is dominated by thousands of
    one-line table rows and headings that can never contain a citation. Both
    numbers were real, neither described the thing being justified, and both
    made the window look tighter than it is. Found by adversarial review, not
    by the author. Standing rule 1 asks for a *derived* parameter, and a
    derivation of the wrong quantity satisfies it only in form.

    The residual over-firing is deliberate. Two sentences in one paragraph,
    one carrying a figure and the other a citation, will be flagged even when
    the figure belongs to neither. That is the conservative direction: the gate
    cannot read a quote against a number in any case (see the module
    docstring), so what it is really asking is whether somebody opened the
    paper being cited in the paragraph that asserts a figure. Answering that
    costs one ``quote`` field; the alternative cost is on record three times.

    The boundaries cut the other way too, and that is the real risk here: every
    rule added to stop over-firing is also a way to wrap out of the gate's
    sight. A blank line mid-sentence silences it, and so did a hard-wrapped
    line that happened to start with a number and a full stop, until the
    ordered-list rule was bounded the way CommonMark bounds it. Those cases are
    in the suite as must-fire, not as known-good.

    fails *invisibly*: what remains still looks like a quote, still sits in a
    ``quote`` field, and still satisfies every other check in this module. What

    ``paper/`` has not been built. The check is written now rather than when the
    build is first run, because the day the build runs is the day 33 silent
    truncations become 33 wrong quotes.

    **The scope is every field, and it started as only ``quote``, which was the
    wrong half.** An independent check pointed out that ``quote`` and
    ``version`` are non-standard fields no standard style prints, so a bare
    ``%`` in them cannot break a build — while ``note``, which every standard
    style *does* typeset, held all 35 of the remaining bare signs. The audited
    field was the safe one. The worst of them is in a retraction:
    ``THE 63.7% IS NOT IN THIS PAPER`` truncates at the percent and the survivor
    reads as the opposite of what was meant. So the rule stopped being about
    ``quote`` and became about the file.
