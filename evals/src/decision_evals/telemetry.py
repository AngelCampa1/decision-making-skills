"""OpenTelemetry GenAI attribute names, hardcoded on purpose.

Track 0.5. A multi-node run needs node identity, a parent, a turn index and a
trace id on every record, and there is a vendor-neutral vocabulary for exactly
that. Hand-rolling a trace schema when one exists is a real weakness, and
MAST-style attribution needs structured traces regardless.

**We adopt the names and not the package.** Every string below was read from
``open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-genai`` at commit :data:`SEMCONV_COMMIT`
and is pinned here. Three facts make importing the library's constants the wrong
call:

* the specification is status **Development**;
* the repository has **zero releases** — checked 2026-08-11, HEAD pushed the day
  before;
* it has already renamed a field in flight, ``gen_ai.system`` →
  ``gen_ai.provider.name``.

A rename upstream would silently change what our columns are called, and columns
that change name between runs are indistinguishable from columns that changed
meaning. Hardcoding costs one edit when the spec settles and buys a record
format that cannot move underneath a result. Nothing here imports
``opentelemetry``; there is no runtime dependency and no socket.

One correction worth recording, because it nearly went the other way. The
inference-span document does **not** list ``gen_ai.agent.name``, and on that
evidence the programme looked wrong to have named it. It is in the attribute
registry, at Development stability, along with ``gen_ai.agent.id`` and
``gen_ai.evaluation.*``. The first document checked is not the specification.
