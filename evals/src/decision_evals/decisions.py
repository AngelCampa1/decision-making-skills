"""The decision register, coupled to the paths where a silent decision costs something.

Maintainer rationale in this repository is genuinely recorded — in commit
bodies, and they are good ones. ``d43c490`` carries the full reasoning for
moving ``x-n21`` to the negatives. But ``git log`` is not greppable by topic and
is invisible to anyone reading ``docs/``, so the reasoning behind the numbers
lives somewhere the numbers do not point.

**Commit trailers were considered and rejected as the store.** Commit messages
here cannot be amended: :func:`~decision_evals.cli.check_git_identity` exists
because the history *is* the pre-registration evidence and rewriting it destroys
the timestamps the method relies on. A trailer somebody forgot would therefore
be permanently unfixable — the one medium in this repository that can never be
corrected. A file can be amended, which is why ``docs/REJECTED.md`` is a file.

**The coupling is the whole design.** A register nobody is obliged to write is a
register that stops being written, and there is no mechanical predicate for
"this commit made a decision" — gating all 131 commits would be noise, and noise
is what an advisory gate becomes before somebody turns it off. So the obligation
attaches to the paths where an undocumented decision has already cost
something, or carries the same shape of risk:

- ``datasets/triggers/`` — the answer key. On 2026-08-13 one turn moved from the
  positives to the negatives; recall rose 3 to 5 points on every arm on disk and
  **not one call was re-made**. That was a correct maintainer decision and it is
  indistinguishable, in a JSONL file, from a model result.
- ``datasets/tailoring/`` — added 2026-08-19. Track H's Phase 0 corpus carries
  labels of the same kind: which arm is *governing* (the answer should move)
  and which is *matched non-governing* (nothing should move). A label move here
  is invisible in a checkpoint for the same reason a trigger label move was.
  This was deliberately not widened to ``datasets/`` as a whole —
  ``datasets/golden/`` already has a stronger gate (byte-exact, ``pytest
  --bless``, diff reviewed) and ``datasets/library/`` carries no labels — see
  ``docs/DECISIONS.md``.
- ``skills/`` — the product. What ships is what the claims are about.
- ``evals/src/decision_evals/arenas.py`` — added 2026-08-24, and it is the one
  governed path that is source rather than data. :data:`~decision_evals.arenas.MODELS`
  decides which runs may become *evidence*: moving one row from ``screen`` to
  ``confirm`` promotes a whole venue's results, and moving one the other way
  demotes every number already published from it. Neither shows up in a
  checkpoint, a label or a diff of the answer key, which is the same
  invisibility the trigger labels had. Scoped to the file rather than to
  ``evals/``, because the rest of the harness computes numbers and this one
  decides which numbers count.

Roughly one commit in ten touches these, which is a volume a person can
actually sustain.

The trigger is *any* change to those paths rather than a ``version:`` bump,
because the defect that motivated this did not bump a version. A rule keyed to
version bumps would have let it through.
