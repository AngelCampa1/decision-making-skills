"""Arena separation.

Three arenas with different permissions, enforced in code rather than by
discipline. The reason is Prompting Inversion (arXiv:2510.22251): a sculpted
prompt helped GPT-4o (97% vs 93%) and *hurt* GPT-5 (94.00% vs 96.36% plain CoT).
Scaffolding tuned against a weak model can become a handicap on a strong one.

So iterating freely against cheap models is fine and expected -- it is where a
skill actually gets good -- and carrying that iteration into a verdict is not.
The separation exists to make the second thing impossible rather than
discouraged, which is exactly the discipline SkillOpt's accept-if-strictly-better
ratchet lacks.

``dev`` and ``screen`` may revise a skill as often as they like. ``confirm`` may
not, runs on the private holdout, and is the only arena that emits a verdict.

**Which models go where lives in :data:`MODELS`, one row per family.** That is a
registry, not a gate on what may be run: ``--model`` still takes any string and
the arena check fires only where a caller asks for it. What the registry decides
is which runs may become *evidence*, and it keys that on the model **and the
backend it is reached through**, because those are two different facts and only
the pair identifies a venue. See :class:`ModelEntry`.

**This file is a governed path, and a change to it needs an entry in
``docs/DECISIONS.md``.** Added 2026-08-24. It is the one governed path that is
source rather than data, because moving a row between arenas promotes or demotes
a whole venue's results and shows up in no checkpoint, no label and no diff of
the answer key. ``de check``'s decision register step refuses a commit here that
nothing explains.

    being hypothetical on 2026-08-21, when ``agy`` turned out to serve
    ``claude-sonnet-4-6``: the same weights this repository calls ``confirm``
    tier through ``claude -p`` also arrive through a backend that wraps every
    call in fourteen thousand tokens of somebody else's agent scaffold with 57
    tools enabled. Pooling those two under one arena because the vendor matches
    would be the precise error the disclosure document exists to prevent.
