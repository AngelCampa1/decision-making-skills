"""Statistics for paired skill-vs-no-skill experiments.

Every published number flows through this subpackage, so it carries a 100% line
and branch coverage floor and is exercised by property-based tests rather than
example-based ones alone.

Three choices here are deliberate and worth stating up front:

*Exact and resampling methods, not the CLT.* Miller's "Adding Error Bars to
Evals" (arXiv:2411.00640) popularised CLT-based standard errors for evals, but
arXiv:2503.01747 shows the normal approximation is unreliable below a few
hundred effectively-independent datapoints. Our item counts sit in exactly that
range once the design effect is applied, so the primary tests are McNemar's
*exact* test and a cluster bootstrap.

*Clusters, not items, are the unit of resampling.* Items generated from one
template are correlated. Treating them as independent understates variance by
the design effect ``1 + (m - 1) * ICC``, which at m=6 and ICC=0.2 discards
roughly half the effective sample.

*The Murphy decomposition is exact, not approximate.* Grouping by unique
forecast value rather than by histogram bin makes ``Brier = Reliability −
Resolution + Uncertainty`` hold to floating-point precision, which turns it into
a property test that catches essentially every decomposition bug.
