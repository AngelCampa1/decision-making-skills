"""Cluster-aware resampling and variance inflation.

Items generated from the same scenario template share structure, wording, and
difficulty, so their outcomes are correlated. The resampling unit must therefore
be the *template*, not the item. Ignoring this is not a rounding error: at six
variants per template and an intraclass correlation of 0.2 the design effect is
2.0, meaning 300 items carry the information of roughly 150.

This is the concrete form of Miller's clustered-standard-error point

    :class:`ClusterBootstrapResult` describes a *paired* difference: the same
    item measured twice, so the difference exists per item and the resampling
    unit carries both arms with it. This describes the other shape — two groups
    of different items, in different clusters, with no pairing available. The
    trigger corpus's length question is exactly that: S+M is 72 items in 24
    triples and L+XL is 48 items in 16 triples, and nothing pairs an S item with
    an L one.

    **The reason this exists rather than two calls to the one-sample form** is
    that a difference interval cannot be recovered by subtracting two independent
    percentile intervals. That subtraction gives an interval for the difference
    of the *bounds*, which is conservative in one direction and simply wrong in
    the other, and it drops the fact that the two groups' resampling error adds
    in variance rather than in width.

    The cost is stark and worth reporting rather than discovering. With ``k``
    clusters the smallest attainable one-sided p is ``2**-k``, so a comparison
    over three templates cannot return anything below 0.125 whatever the data
    say. :attr:`SignFlipResult.floor` carries that number, and
    :attr:`SignFlipResult.could_reject` reads it against 0.05.

    Enumerates all ``2**k`` sign vectors when ``k <= exhaustive_limit``, which
    makes the p exact rather than sampled. Above it, samples.

    Args:
        differences: Per-item signed difference, treatment minus control.
        clusters: Cluster label per item, same order and length.
        alternative: ``"greater"``, ``"less"`` or ``"two-sided"``.
        n_resamples: Sign vectors drawn when not enumerating.
        seed: Seed for the sampled path. Ignored when enumerating.
        exhaustive_limit: Largest ``k`` to enumerate. ``2**20`` vectors is the
            point where enumerating stops being the cheaper option.

    Returns:
        A :class:`SignFlipResult`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: On mismatched lengths, empty input, ``n_resamples < 1``, or
            an unknown ``alternative``.
