"""False discovery rate control across the pre-registered family of skills.

Five skills means five primary tests. Testing each at α = 0.05 gives roughly a
23% chance of at least one false positive, which would be exactly the kind of
unadjusted-comparison problem this project is positioned against.

Benjamini-Hochberg is used rather than Bonferroni: with five hypotheses in a
single family, controlling the *proportion* of false discoveries preserves far
more power than controlling the probability of *any* false discovery, and a
single spurious skill among several genuine ones is a tolerable error here.

Guards are deliberately excluded from correction. They are one-sided
non-inferiority tests in the conservative direction, so adjusting them upward
would make it *easier* for a harmful skill to pass its guard — the correction
would work against safety rather than for it.
