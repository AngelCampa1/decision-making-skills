"""Command-line entry point for the harness.

``de check`` is the whole local gate: lint, types, tests, coverage floors, and
the repository-integrity checks. It makes no model calls and is fully

introducing flakes.

Model-backed evaluation deliberately lives behind separate commands. Anything

    Nothing runs on construction. The callables are built and returned
    unevaluated, so the gate can be enumerated without being run -- which is
    what lets a document state the steps without a person retyping them.

    The four steps ``--fast`` drops need a Node toolchain, git history, or the
    test suite. They are demanded at pre-push instead of on every commit, which
    is a latency decision and says nothing about how much they matter.
