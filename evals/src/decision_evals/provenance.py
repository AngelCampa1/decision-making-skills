"""Provenance of published run records.

Every number this repository shows a reader lives in a
``results/<skill>/<date>-<sha7>[-slug]/README.md``. Those READMEs are the best
documentation in the repository and they were, until this module existed, the
only part of the method with **no gate at all**. Everything around them is
checked — lint, types, citations, trigger sets, coverage floors — while the
record of *what was run, against which labels, and what was predicted first*
was maintained entirely by remembering.

Remembering did not work. Three defects of exactly this shape are already on
the record:

- **A run with no registered bands.** ``results/decision-making/2026-08-12-40b6ba5/``
  is 365 calls published with a write-up and no prediction. It is the run
  ``CLAUDE.md`` describes as "launched with no bands at all", and it is the one
  run in ``results/`` this gate refuses.
- **A prediction written after its run had started.** Nothing in a file records
  when it was written, so the check is the commit graph: the prediction's
  first commit must be an ancestor of the commit the run was made at. A
  prediction that cannot be shown to predate its data is not evidence, it is a
  story with a date on it.
- **An answer key that moved under finished results.** On 2026-08-13 one turn
  moved from the positives to the negatives and recall rose on every arm on
  disk with **no call re-made**. :func:`~decision_evals.trigger_arms.label_versions_comparable`
  now guards the JSONL. It cannot guard the prose, and the prose is what gets
  quoted — so a README must state the answer-key version its numbers were
  computed under, and that statement must match the records in the same
  directory.

The last rule is the one worth stating plainly: **this module binds the prose
to the data.** A README claiming v1 beside records stamped v2 is the exact
construction that produced five unearned points of recall, and it is invisible
to every other check in the gate.

**The baseline is the citations baseline, with the same semantics.** Runs
published before the convention existed are exempt by name, each with a written
reason, and the list *may only shrink* — a baseline that does not shrink when
work is done has stopped measuring anything.
