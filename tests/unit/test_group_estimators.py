"""The three grouping estimators a held pre-registration names, and the guards around them.

N6's pre-registration registers three bands whose estimators did not exist:
routing accuracy per procedure, false-positive rate per negative kind, and the
difference in firing accuracy between the short bands and the long ones. The
third is the experiment; the first two are the bands that would otherwise be
scored by eye.

**Every test here is written to the same standard the estimators are for.**
Standing rule 2 — *a falsifier must be run against a known-good case before it
may fail anything* — so each refusal is paired with the nearest input that must
be accepted, and each estimator is shown both separating groups that differ and
declining to separate groups that do not. A statistic that always separates is
as broken as one that never does, and neither announces itself.

    """Coverage simulation. **The test that says the interval means anything.**

    Data are generated under a known true difference, the estimator is run many
    times, and the share of intervals containing the truth is counted. An
    interval that covers 80% of the time is not a 95% interval, and nothing
    about its output would say so.

    Run at 16 and 24 clusters — the real L+XL and S+M counts — because coverage
    of a percentile bootstrap is governed by the number of clusters, not by the
    number of items, and quoting a coverage measured at 200 clusters would be
    quoting a different estimator.

    **Realised coverage: 0.926 over 2,000 replications at 600 resamples**
    (Monte Carlo standard error 0.005), against a nominal 0.95.

    The shortfall is real, it is about two and a half points, and it is the
    cluster *count* rather than anything about the estimator. A sweep at 2,000
    replications each, run before this test was written:

    ======================================  ========  ========
    setting                                 truth     coverage
    ======================================  ========  ========
    0.80 → 0.90, 16 / 24 clusters           +0.1042   0.9325
    0.80 → 0.80, 16 / 24 clusters (null)    −0.0002   0.9310
    0.50 → 0.60, 16 / 24 clusters           +0.0878   0.9295
    0.80 → 0.90, 60 / 90 clusters           +0.1042   0.9460
    ======================================  ========  ========

    Three things follow. The shortfall does **not** come from the ceiling at 1.0
    — it is the same at a base rate of 0.5, where there is no ceiling. It is not
    an artefact of a non-null truth — the null row is no better. And it goes
    away as clusters are added, which is what small-sample percentile-bootstrap
    behaviour looks like and what a bug does not.

    So a band read off this interval at the real corpus size is **very slightly
    liberal**: a nominal 95% interval is really about a 93% one. That belongs in
    the run's README, and it is not worth correcting with a BCa interval that
    nobody here could check. It is asserted loosely below so the test measures
    the estimator rather than the seed.
